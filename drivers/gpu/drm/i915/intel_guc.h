/*
 * This structure primarily describes the GEM object shared with the GuC.
 * The GEM object is held for the entire lifetime of our interaction with
 * the GuC, being allocated before the GuC is loaded with its firmware.
 * Because there's no way to update the address used by the GuC after
 * initialisation, the shared object must stay pinned into the GGTT as
 * long as the GuC is in use. We also keep the first page (only) mapped
 * into kernel address space, as it includes shared data that must be
 * updated on every request submission.
 *
 * The single GEM object described here is actually made up of several
 * separate areas, as far as the GuC is concerned. The first page (kept
 * kmap'd) includes the "process decriptor" which holds sequence data for
 * the doorbell, and one cacheline which actually *is* the doorbell; a
 * write to this will "ring the doorbell" (i.e. send an interrupt to the
 * GuC). The subsequent  pages of the client object constitute the work
 * queue (a circular array of work items), again described in the process
 * descriptor. Work queue pages are mapped momentarily as required.
 *
 * We also keep a few statistics on failures. Ideally, these should all
 * be zero!
 *   no_wq_space: times that the submission pre-check found no space was
 *                available in the work queue (note, the queue is shared,
 *                not per-engine). It is OK for this to be nonzero, but
 *                it should not be huge!
 *   q_fail: failed to enqueue a work item. This should never happen,
 *           because we check for space beforehand.
 *   b_fail: failed to ring the doorbell. This should never happen, unless
 *           somehow the hardware misbehaves, or maybe if the GuC firmware
 *           crashes? We probably need to reset the GPU to recover.
 *   retcode: errno from last guc_submit()
