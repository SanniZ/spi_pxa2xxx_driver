/**
 * DOC: HuC Firmware
 *
 * Motivation:
 * GEN9 introduces a new dedicated firmware for usage in media HEVC (High
 * Efficiency Video Coding) operations. Userspace can use the firmware
 * capabilities by adding HuC specific commands to batch buffers.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * On supported platforms, i915's job is to load the firmware stored on the
 * file system and assist with authentication. It is up to userspace to
 * detect the presence of HuC support on a platform, on their own.
 * For debugging, i915 provides a debugfs file, i915_huc_load_status_info
 * which displays the firmware load status.
 *
 * The unified uC firmware loader is used. Firmware binary is fetched by the
 * loader asynchronously from the driver init process. However, the actual
 * loading to HW is deferred until GEM initialization is done. Be note that HuC
 * firmware loading must be done before GuC loading.
